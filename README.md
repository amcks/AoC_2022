Advent of Code (AoC) 2022
========

This repository is intended as documentation for my attempt at solving the 25 two-part puzzles included as part of the [AoC 2022 event](https://adventofcode.com/).

All of the puzzles will be attempted in the Python language unless otherwise stated. As much as possible, the base solutions will make use of only functions or modules that are natively available in Python 3 without the need for installing additional packages.

If multiple solution scripts are present (typically as files ending in *_alt.py*), these would be alternate solutions, in which, I attempt to solve them again in a different way, which could include any of the following:
* Fewer lines of code
* Faster computation time
* Using different approaches
* Using third-party packages
